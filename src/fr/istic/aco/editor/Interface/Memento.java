 * The {@code Memento} interface is a marker interface used to represent a

 * objects
 * like {@link Engine}, {@link Selection}, or other components of the editor.
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface should contain the necessary methods to
 * capture
 * and retrieve the state of an object.
